Horde running on GPU. This is a first version and still requires a lot of work. It most likely still contain bugs (use at your own risk).
Very soon, sparse vectors will be added to the project allowing for great speed ups. As it stands, the opencl-horde needs a great number of demons to see any performance gain over cpu, this will change soon.
